# Bike Sharing Study

A client wants to start a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa and he wants to use bike sharing data from New York City in order to pitch potential investors.  While Des Moines and New York City are quite different, my client is hoping to find enough similarities to make his pitch. The visualizations can be seen at this link:

## Preliminary Data

In determining the viability of a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa, I first wanted to examine who uses the bikes and when. This first graph shows "customers" and "subscribers" and what time they used the bikes in New York City. It becomes apparent that “subscribers” make up most of the riders and they use the bikes during commute times typically seen during start and end times for work.

Next, I wanted to see if there were any areas of New York that bikes were checked out more than others. Was the bike sharing program city wide or concentrated in a particular district?

As with the previous graph, I felt it was important to see if the start locations and the end locations had any type of relationship. You can see that most bike start and end points are in the same area.

The following line graph is interesting. It displays how long a particular rider used the bike. Most trips are very short and suggest that the bikes are used as an easy way to ride a few blocks, possibly to work.

The graph below displays the same information as the previous one but breaks the riders down by gender. Given that the hypothesis is that the bikes are used for short commutes to work, it is understandable that men use the bikes more than women. Dresses do not lend themselves to bike riding.

The following heat map confirms that most bike trips occur at the start of the working day and the end of the workday. It is becoming apparent that if a bike sharing program is going to be successful in Des Moines, it needs to have a high-density business district that would attract “subscribers” to the service.

Supporting evidence that men use the bikes more than women.

Finally, an illustration displaying the days of the week that the bikes are used the most. Again, reaffirming the notion that most bike rides are used during the week for short commutes to work.

## Conclusion 

My client is going to have a difficult time convincing a group of investors that a bike sharing program will work in Des Moines, if he is solely relying on data from New York City. The two cities are vastly different and not a good comparison. What can be used, however, is the data that supports bike sharing in a densely populated business district. Of, course the scale in Des Moines does not have to be that of New York City, but a similar need must be present.

Two additional visualizations that would shed more light on the potential of the Des Moines bike sharing program would be: 1) Weather patterns. Does Des Moines have the weather needed for a successful bike sharing program? Yes, New York City has harsh weather at times, but does this limit the number of users? The data presented was only for August. Weather and user data should also be collected from colder months. 2) Pricing and upkeep data. None of the data presented showed anything that investors look for, in particular return on investment and cost.
